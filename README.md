# Repository structure
* The [hardware](https://github.com/Squantor/selfMixingLaserRanger/tree/master/hardware) directory contains all the release and prototyping hardware.
* The [software](https://github.com/Squantor/selfMixingLaserRanger/tree/master/software) directory contains all the software for the ranger. Microcontroller of choice is the LPC824 as it is small, cheap and powerful enough for this application.
* The [documentation](https://github.com/Squantor/selfMixingLaserRanger/tree/master/documentation) directory contains lab notes when working on this project.
