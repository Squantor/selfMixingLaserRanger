## Diode verification
Started by measuring my [ebay laser diodes](https://www.ebay.com/itm/223016401263) [ADL-65052TL](https://github.com/Squantor/selfMixingLaserRanger/tree/master/documentation/datasheets/ADL-65052TL_6-2D-LD65-004_REV01.pdf) if they really are diodes with a photodiode feedback. What I know from experience is that the low power diodes (5mw) usually have a photodiode as the margins between not working, lasing and destructions are pretty small and sensitive to temperature. But best to make sure this is the real deal.
## Determine pinout
The Laserfaq has a [good guide](http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laserdio.htm#diodct2) in figuring out the pinout of unknown laser diodes. This worked better then expected in my case, one difference was. The photodiode was about 0.4V output when I shine a pretty bright LED on it but the laser diode output was almost a volt! Either I shone into it quite well or this diode is a bit more sensitive. They do mention that you should shine a tungsten bulb lamp on it, not a white LED. In any case, the pinout matched the datasheet.
## Firin my lazor!
Okay, now I have that meme out of the way. It is time to determine lasing current of the diode.
