# Lab notes 20190625
Some additional progress has been made, started on a simple prototype to figure out what to measure and how.
## Setup

Prototyping board with:
* constant current sink driving the laser diode
* transimpedance amplifier for the laser photodiode
* LPC824 microcontroller breakout
* USB to uart
* debugger connection with a black box probe (not on picture)

Shining a laser on the only retroreflector I have in house.

## Laser diode current drive
Currently implemented as a constant current sink with a 10 Ohm resistor and a [TLC271 CMOS opamp](http://www.ti.com/product/TLC271).

The laser diode is the load.

 The reference voltage is created by using the 3.3V that usually supplies the microcontroller and that feeds a 100K trimpot in series with a resistor to scale down the current setting voltage not to something full range. The 3.3V would imply a current of 330mA, way too much for this diode. It is settable from 0 to 600mV, that means settable from 0 to 60mV.
### Final implementation
Next step is to replace to control the current loop of the laser diode via the microcontroller. A filtered PWM signal can drive the bipolar transistor and the current can be sensed by the ADC directly.
## Photodiode sense
Photodiode of the laser is sensed via a transimpedance amplifier using a 10KOhm feedback resistor with a 22pF capacitor parallel, the opamp chosen is one half of a [TLC272](http://www.ti.com/product/TLC272). The topology is not completely standard. The photodiode is connected to highest voltage rail, so a classical transimpedance amplifier would need to drive its output negative to ground, not really possible in a single supply environment. So the non inverting input was connected to the reference so the output now goes from 3.3V to 0V depending on the light falling on the photodiode, perfect for sensing with a a microcontroller.

This is starting to look like something that applied science showed.

## debug connections
I can easely hook up various parts to various ADC channels of the microcontroller for monitoring. The LPC824 is quick and precise enough to perform a few functions. The coax connections above is useful to hooking a oscilloscope up to signals of interest without messing around with probes.

## next steps
* Create a Opamp AC amplifier that will filter out the AC signal and amplify it some more, gain of 10 should be okay as the output of the transimpedance amplifier is about 100mV AC coupled.
* Capture DC and AC from the photodiode with the microcontroller ADC
* Change current control to be microcontroller controlled with just a PWM DAC and bipolar transistor.
* Start with initial schematic in kicad
